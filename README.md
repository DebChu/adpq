# Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Agile Development-Digital Services Refresh 2018

In February 2018, the California Department of Technology (CDT) will conduct a Request for Information (RFI) to refresh the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Agile Development - Digital Services (PQVP AD-DS) that was established in July 2016. 

The pool is designed to provide approved state agencies with access to user-centered design and agile software development services. The existing pool is comprised of 24 vendors, and through this refresh process, the pool could expand up to 35 vendors.  


### The Benefits:
* Reduction in solicitation time and administrative costs for both the State and vendor
* Ability to review vendors’ user-centric design and agile software development competencies prior to solicitation

### The Process:
* CDT has released a draft of the proposed RFI to all interested vendors (see above file) to allow for vendor feedback and comments. 

### The Results:
CDT will release an Official RFI in February 2018, that may incorporate feedback provided by the vendor community.  As such, CDT advises all interested parties, including incumbent vendors, to review the RFI thoroughly and submit any feedback and/or comments by the due date identified in Section A.1 PQVP AD-DS, Key Action Dates.
